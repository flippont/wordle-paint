# wordle-paint

## Basics

Wordle paint is a tool to help create pixel art patterns for wordle games. you can design a 5x6 grid using three colours (white, yellow, green) and generate possible word combinations that fit the pattern. it also includes preset designs and letters for easy pattern creation.

## Notes

Note that the algorithm is far from perfect, and in the case where the word lookup takes more than 1 second it terminates itself.
